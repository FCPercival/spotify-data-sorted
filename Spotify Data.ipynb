    "## More than Meets the Ear: The Data and Elements Behind Spotify Songs\n",
    "Since its humble beginnings in Sweden, **Spotify** has continually grown exponentially to become one of, if not, the world's biggest music streaming provider. Boasting an immense catalog of tracks from around the world, the music giant has gathered mounds of valuable data, both basic and complex, behind the songs deployed in its massive database. For this Notebook, the researchers **Anjelo Antioquia**, **Gabriel Minamedez**, and **Julian Sunpayco** will report their findings in this case study centered around two (2) datasets gathered from online data science community Kaggle related to the songs in Spotify.\n",

    "## Dataset #1: The Main Spotify Dataset\n",
    "The [Spotify dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv) (titled **`data.csv`**) consists of 160,000+ tracks from 1921-2020 found in Spotify as of June 2020. Collected by Kaggle user and Turkish Data Scientist Yamaç Eren Ay, the data was retrieved and tabulated from the **Spotify Web API**. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a track, with variables such as the title, artist, and year located in their respective columns. Aside from the fundamental variables, musical elements of each track, such as the tempo, danceability, and key, were likewise extracted from the Spotify Web API; the algorithm for these values were generated by Spotify based on a range of technical parameters.\n",

    "With a huge array of variables present as seen above, it may seem overwhelming, but don't be! Each of these variables describe a track in each row, giving each some interesting numerical context across different parameters. Below is the list of variables and their descriptions:\n",
    "- **`id`**: A unique identifier for each track.\n",
    "- **`name`**: The track's title.\n",
    "- **`artists`**: Artist/s who participated in the track.\n",
    "- **`duration_ms`**: Length of the track in milliseconds (ms).\n",
    "- **`release_date`**: The track's release date in MM/DD/YYYY, or at the minimum, YYYY.\n",
    "- **`year`**: The year in which the track was released.\n",
    "- **`acousticness`***: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\n",
    "- **`danceability`***: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "- **`energy`***: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast and loud.\n",
    "- **`instrumentalness`***: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.\n",
    "- **`liveness`***: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.\n",
    "- **`loudness`***: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).\n",
    "- **`speechiness`***: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.\n",
    "- **`tempo`***: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).\n",
    "- **`valence`***: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.\n",
    "- **`mode`**: Melodic content from the modality of a track. 1 = Major; 0 = Minor.\n",
    "- **`key`**: The estimated overall key of a track from the [Pitch Class notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class). E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n",
